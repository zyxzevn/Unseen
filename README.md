# Unseen
Visual Unseen is a visual programming language that uses functional and logical components.
Components are like objects that can be extended.
Everything can be a function, so there is no need for macros or templates.


The simple basics of Unseen are explained in these diagrams:

In basis this language can be easy enough for children.

While simple, the power of Unseen comes from the ability to do both high-level abstractions
and low-level coding. 

It has all forms of typing, but encourages incremental typing combined with incremental 
function-level testing. That way one can build a system from a high abstraction level,
and slowly fill in the details and optimisations.

As you see there is no code yet.
That is because I want the design to be complete first.
